Differences between Maven and Gradle

Maven and Gradle are both build tools used in Java and other JVM-based projects to automate the building, testing, and deployment of software applications. Here are some of the main differences between the two:

1- Configuration: Maven uses an XML configuration file called pom.xml, while Gradle uses a Groovy or Kotlin-based DSL (Domain-Specific Language) for its configuration.

2- Plugin system: Both tools have a plugin system that allows developers to extend their functionality. However, Gradle's plugin system is more flexible and easier to use than Maven's.

3- Learning curve: Maven is easier to learn than Gradle, as it has a simpler configuration syntax and a smaller learning curve. Gradle's DSL is more powerful but requires more time to master.
