Differences between maven and gradle
Maven and Gradle are both popular build automation tools used in the software development industry.
Here are the key differences between the two:

1. Configuration: Maven uses an XML-based configuration file, while Gradle uses a Groovy-based configuration file.
 This means that Gradle is more flexible and expressive in terms of configuring build tasks.
