Five Maven and Gradle differnces

1. Build Script Language:
Maven uses an XML-based configuration file(pom.xml)to define the build process,while Cradle uses a Groovy-based or Kotlin-based build script(build.gradle or build.gradle.kts) that allows for more flexiblity and customization.


2.Performance:
Gradle is generally considered to be faster than Maven because it uses a build cache to avoid rebuilding dependencies that haven't changed.In contrast,maven does not have a built-in caching mechanism and relies on incremental builds to speed up the build process.


3.Dependency Management:
Maven has a more rigid approach to dependency management and relies on a central repository to download and manage dependencies. Gradle, onthe other hand, allows for more flexibility and can pull dependencies from multiple sources, including Maven repositories.
