Difference between MAVEN and GRADLE
Configuration: Maven uses XML and it is less expensive while Gradle uses Groovy or Kotlin and it is more flexible and expressive.
Performance: Performance: Gradle is generally faster, especially for large projects. This is because Gradle uses a dependency graph to determine which tasks need to be executed, while Maven uses a linear build order.
Plugin ecosystem: Gradle's plugin ecosystem is more extensive and easier to use than Maven's.
Flexibility: Gradle is more flexible than Maven and can be used for a wider range of tasks, including building native applications, Android apps, and even non-Java projects.
